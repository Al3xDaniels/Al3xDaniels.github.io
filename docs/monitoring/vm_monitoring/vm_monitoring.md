# Best Practices for Monitoring Virtual Machines in Azure

Azure Monitor provides a **comprehensive set of tools** to track reliability, security, cost, operations, and performance of virtual machines. Following best practices ensures optimal monitoring, issue detection, and cost efficiency.

## **ðŸ”¹ Reliability**
Failures are inevitable; the goal is to **minimize impact**.  
âœ” Create **availability alerts** to track VM uptime.  
âœ” Set up **agent heartbeat alerts** to monitor VM agent health.  
âœ” Configure **log-based alerting** for client workloads.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Security**
Protecting virtual machines requires **defense-in-depth**.  
âœ” Use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for advanced security insights.  
âœ” Secure VM connections to Azure Monitor using **Private Link**.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Cost Optimization**
Optimizing data collection can **reduce monitoring costs**.  
âœ” Migrate to **Azure Monitor Agent** for efficient data filtering.  
âœ” Disable unnecessary data collection to lower ingestion costs.  
âœ” Use **Log Analytics Workspace Insights** to track spending.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Operational Excellence**
Simplify monitoring management across environments.  
âœ” Deploy agents using **Azure Policy** for automated monitoring.  
âœ” Use **Azure Arc** to monitor VMs outside of Azure.  
âœ” Establish structured **Data Collection Rules (DCRs)** for efficiency.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Performance Efficiency**
Ensure VMs can **scale and perform efficiently**.  
âœ” Configure **performance monitoring** for client workloads.  
âœ” Set **proactive alerting** to detect potential performance issues.
