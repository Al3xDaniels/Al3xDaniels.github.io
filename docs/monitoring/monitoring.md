# Azure Monitoring Overview

Azure provides a **comprehensive suite of monitoring tools** to help organizations gain visibility, detect issues, and optimize performance across their cloud resources. This section explores key Azure monitoring services and best practices.

## **üîç Key Capabilities of Azure Monitoring**
Azure Monitoring helps businesses **observe, analyze, and respond** to system behavior with the following core capabilities:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure & Performance Monitoring**
- **Azure Monitor** ‚Äì Collects, analyzes, and acts on telemetry data from Azure resources, applications, and VMs.
- **Azure Application Insights** ‚Äì Provides deep insights into application performance, request tracking, and user behavior.
- **Azure Metrics** ‚Äì Tracks real-time performance indicators (CPU, memory, network, etc.) for Azure resources.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging & Diagnostics**
- **Azure Log Analytics** ‚Äì Queries and analyzes logs from different sources in a centralized workspace.
- **Azure Diagnostic Settings** ‚Äì Enables detailed logging and diagnostic data collection for resources.
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** ‚Äì Used in Log Analytics to run powerful log queries.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Alerting & Automation**
- **Azure Alerts** ‚Äì Triggers notifications or automated actions based on predefined conditions.
- **Azure Action Groups** ‚Äì Sends alerts via email, SMS, webhooks, or integrates with ITSM tools.
- **Azure Auto-Healing** ‚Äì Automates remediation for detected issues through Logic Apps and Functions.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Compliance Monitoring**
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** ‚Äì Provides security insights, recommendations, and alerts for Azure workloads.
- **Azure Security Center** ‚Äì Monitors security posture and enforces compliance policies.
